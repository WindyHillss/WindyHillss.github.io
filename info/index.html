    <h2>Profile Card</h2>
    <p>
        This profile card showcases Discord statuses such as active, online, or offline, along with the user's profile picture. The data is fetched in real-time from <code>https://api.lanyard.rest/</code>. 
        The card is designed to resemble a Windows-style window and can be freely dragged around the screen by holding the top title bar.
    </p>
    <p>
        The bottom area of the card provides space for custom links, with subtle hover effects for better interactivity. Additionally, the card content can be used as a link to navigate directly to the radio site.
    </p>
    <p>
        To create a visually immersive experience, a leaf animation script harmonizes with the background image, and a campfire sound adds ambiance. The sound only plays after user interaction to comply with browser autoplay policies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Social media links such as Pinterest, Discord, and Spotify are included within the card, each with hover effects to indicate interactivity.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the bottom-left of the site, author and copyright information is displayed, while the bottom-right provides attribution for the background image with a clickable link.
    </p>
    <p>
        The site also includes an Easter Egg: typing a secret keyword ("gwen") triggers a dynamic video background, enhancing the interactivity and surprise element of the site.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, this site is designed to inform users while providing a rich interactive experience combining live data, animations, sound effects, and playful hidden features.

    <h2>Radio</h2>
    <p>
        This interactive radio box allows users to listen to a live streaming radio station directly from the site. 
        The currently playing station is displayed with a clickable link to access it in a new tab.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users can also download the radio player application directly via the provided download link. 
        The audio will only start playing after user interaction, in compliance with browser autoplay policies.
    </p>
    <p>
        The radio box includes a volume slider for real-time adjustment and a duration timer that shows how long the user has been listening.
    </p>
    <p>
        The box mimics a Windows-style window, with draggable functionality. Users can move the radio box anywhere on the screen by holding the title bar at the top.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, a background leaf animation runs behind the interface, creating a visually immersive experience that complements the site's overall aesthetic.
    </p>

<!-- Article Section 3 -->
<div class="article">
    <h2>Radio.exe</h2>
    <p>
        The size of the Radio application (109MB) is due to it being written in C# and including .NET frameworks and necessary packages, which naturally take up significant storage space.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Radio.exe application streams the same radio station as the website URL, ensuring no difference in playback or delay.
    </p>
    <p>
        Radio.exe does not contain any malicious commands or directories. If you are curious about the contents of the executable, you can contact me via Discord: 
        <a href="https://discord.com/users/607103362558722060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:#1da1f2;">Discord</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The application features a minimal Windows-style interface, including draggable title bars, a system tray icon, and Discord Rich Presence integration. It allows users to play or stop the radio, and all functions mirror the live web radio experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        The buttons in the Radio interface are perfectly positioned to blend with the background. If you had any trouble locating them, sorry about that! :)
